### Academic Background

My academic journey includes a DUT (University Technology Diploma), a bachelor's degree, and an apprenticeship-based training in the field of computer science. I also earned a degree in Software Architecture Design, which strengthened my skills in software design, and I completed my education as an engineer in computer science (CNAM engineer).

### My Skills

As an IT professional, I wear multiple hats: I am a DevSecOps, a system administrator, and an architect. I am versatile and capable of handling all technical aspects of projects. Whether it's coding an application, crafting Ansible scripts, or managing my own infrastructure, I can do it all, and I'm passionate about every aspect of my work.

### My Passions

Beyond my professional life, I have various interests. I enjoy playing Magic and Warhammer, exploring mountains, rivers, and the beauty of nature in general. Occasionally, I like to find solitude to clear my mind and contemplate new projects. I find satisfaction in going to bed each night knowing I've accomplished meaningful work and delivered high-quality results.

### My Pursuit of Perfection

One of my most defining characteristics is my unyielding pursuit of perfection. As a primarily self-taught individual, I've independently acquired the vast majority of my knowledge. This has instilled in me a strong commitment to self-honesty and the ability to critically assess my own ideas, projects, designs, and creations.

My relentless pursuit of perfection is an ongoing challenge that I embrace with enthusiasm. I have an innate passion for continuous improvement, which frequently leads me to uncover innovative approaches to tasks. At times, this compels me to revisit previous projects to elevate them to my current standards. My unwavering commitment to excellence propels me to continually explore avenues for optimization and refinement in my work, even if it necessitates revisiting elements that were previously considered complete. This process serves as the driving force behind my passion for the field of computing and keeps me consistently pushing the boundaries of my skills and creativity.

### My Technical Environment

I own my own mini data center with 9 hypervisors and 2 storage servers, hosting over 80 VMs and LXCs. I utilize these resources to create my own development, testing, validation, and production environments. I am also agnostic when it comes to online services, working with cloud solutions, Kubernetes, game servers, applications, database clusters, automation, websites, service platforms, and much more.

My multifaceted approach is an asset to any team, even if it means I may not be an expert in a specific domain. Nevertheless, I consistently strive to maintain a high level of quality and rigor in everything I do.

I am open to new opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing. Please don't hesitate to reach out to discuss exciting projects or share ideas. I firmly believe in lifelong learning and am always ready to evolve and grow as an IT professional.
